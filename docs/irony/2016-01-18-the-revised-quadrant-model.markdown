Figures 1-3: The Quadrant Model I originally developed on a [post in /tpm/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/memetics/posts/977052182344137/) on 2015-11-17.

Figure 4: An analogy of art history and ironic memes developed for the lecture at Humboldt University. I show that premodernism is analogous to Pre-Ironic memes, modernism is analogous to Ironic memes, postmodernism is analogous to Meta-Ironic memes, and metamodernism is analogous to Post-Ironic memes.

Figure 5: Revised version of the Quadrant Model. I show that Post-Irony and Meta-Irony has 2 layers of irony, which is the maximum number of layers of irony a meme can have.
